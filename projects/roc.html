<!--ROC or Room Occupancy Counter is an electronic device that I developed with the arrival of the pandemic to keep track of the number of people inside a room and sound an alarm when it exceeded a limit.-->

                        <p>ROC or Room Occupancy Counter is a project I created as a preventive measure during the pandemic. It consists of two ultrasonic sensors placed one above the other to detect interruptions in distances and identify if a person has passed in front of them. The reason for having two sensors is to determine which one detected the person first, in order to determine if they are entering or exiting the room.</p><br>
                        <p>In addition, the device had a user interface that allowed navigation through options such as manually changing the current number of people, resetting the device, changing operating modes, modifying the person limit, displaying data on the LCD screen, and playing a sound when the maximum number of people was exceeded.</p><br>
                        <p>To ensure that the idea didn't remain limited to just myself and my acquaintances, I decided to create a step-by-step <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Rom-Occupancy-Counter/" target="_blank">guide</a> on how to build the device so that it could be replicated anywhere in the world.</p><br>
                        <p>During the time it was relevant, I received several messages from people who had built the device themselves. However, once a group of friends from Indonesia shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XSxSdnZA7M" target="_blank">video</a> with me showcasing the device in action. This demonstrated the significant impact my contribution had on the community.</p>
