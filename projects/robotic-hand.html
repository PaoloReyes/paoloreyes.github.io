                        <p>This project was carried out during the pandemic. The idea originated in collaboration with Erick Fernández, a boy of my age who was also part of the robotics club. I mentioned to him that we could create a robotic hand using simple materials like straws, servomotors, and an Arduino. As soon as I shared this idea with him, we quickly built a first prototype of a hand controlled by programming commands using the suggested materials. Later on, Erick independently developed a second version of this hand that would be 3D printed. It would still be driven by the same servomotors, but its true innovation would lie in its control method. By using a glove with variable resistance sensors on each finger, we could replicate the movements of a real hand on the robotic hand.</p><br>
                        <p>When the second prototype was completed, the pandemic hit and we couldn't continue with the development. However, I decided to continue working on it at home as a way to improve my skills. I started by redesigning the hand to better accommodate the components. Then, I 3D printed all the parts and brought it to life with higher quality servomotors and an Arduino as the brain. I also added a Bluetooth connection to establish communication with my computer and enable more complex processing. With this new computational capability, I developed a program that could translate any word you typed into sign language, letter by letter. Additionally, I implemented a voice recognition feature so that you could speak any word, and the hand would translate it for you.</p><br>
                        <p>The final idea of this project was to continue its development and create a complete exoskeleton that could provide a more natural sign language translation and be applicable in classrooms to facilitate the learning of deaf individuals. Although I haven't completed this project yet, it remains on my to-do list, and I plan to pursue it as soon as I have the necessary budget to carry it out.</p><br>
                        <p>During the development of the early prototypes, several local newspapers featured us in their reports, which can be found at the following links.</p>
