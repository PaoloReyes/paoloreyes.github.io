<!--A project to assist people with paralysis in moving independently is a head-controlled electronic wheelchair. This wheelchair is designed to be operated by the movements of the user's head.-->

                        <p>This project originated from a task during my third semester of high school, where a group of friends and I were tasked with developing a prototype that addressed a specific problem. In collaboration with my robotics team, we came up with the idea of creating an electric wheelchair in which each wheel was powered by a motor. The speed and direction of the wheelchair were controlled by the tilting motion of an accelerometer placed in a headband worn by the user. The accelerometer data was interpreted by an Arduino Uno, making it easy for the user to navigate through space.</p><br>
                        <p>This project received a lot of recognition both within and outside the institution, and related news articles can be found at the following links:</p>
