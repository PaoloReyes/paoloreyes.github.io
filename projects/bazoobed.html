                        <p>In my final semester of high school, the school announced an internal robotics competition at the national level. The competition involved fabricating a robot capable of popping 12 balloons located around the perimeter of a square field in the shortest time possible.</p><br><p>My approach to solving this problem was straightforward. I decided to fabricate a modified NERF gun, where I attached a needle to the tip of the darts. This way, I could pop the balloons with precision. The modified gun was connected to two motorized axes that allowed for adjusting the shooting angle both horizontally (left to right) and vertically (up and down).</p><br><p>The principle of operation was simple. Two servo motors controlled the shooting angle, while two 6-volt motors rotated in opposite directions to accelerate and fire the darts. Finally, a smaller-sized third servo motor pushed the darts from their cartridge into the motors for launching.</p><br><p>In the electronics area, an ATmega328P microcontroller would be used as the brain of the robot. A Bluetooth module would enable communication between the robot and a computer. Various sensors such as infrared sensors and potentiometers would be utilized to determine the shooting position accurately at all times.</p><br><p>I finished in second place in the competition after experiencing a disconnection issue with the Bluetooth module just before popping the last balloon. The reconnection process took a significant amount of time, causing a delay in completing the task. Despite this setback, achieving the second-place position is still a commendable accomplishment.</p>
