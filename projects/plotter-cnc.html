                        <p>CNC machines are my favorite devices on the planet, but buying or even building one tends to be very expensive. That's why, during the pandemic, I became curious to learn more about how they work. The first device of this kind that I made was an <a href="./eggcnc" target="_blank">eggbot</a>, but I still wanted to create something more akin to a traditional CNC machine. That's when I built this machine with three movable axes, "x," "y," and "z," using components from an old printer, and I used an Arduino to bring it to life. The program I used was a library called GRBL, so I didn't have to write any code. All I needed to do was convert the drawings I wanted to create into "G-code," a language understood by these types of machines, and press start to begin drawing.</p>
