<!--During one winter, in collaboration with ASCI! (an organization dedicated to promoting and teaching sciences), I taught robotics courses with Arduino to children aged 12 to 15 years old.-->

                        <p>In January 2023, I received the news that the project I had previously conducted with a group of engineering students in July of the previous year, which aimed to teach robotics using LEGO, would be repeated. However, this time, we would be using the Arduino platform and a block-based programming interface to facilitate learning instead of directly having them write code in C. Excited about the opportunity, I decided to embark on this adventure again, this time as a tutor for five girls and five boys. My goal was to teach them everything they needed to know to program a robot capable of obstacle avoidance.</p><br><p>In this project, the challenge remained the same as in its first edition. The most difficult part was not transmitting the technical knowledge but finding ways to communicate the topics in a way that would not bore the children. It was important to keep their interest and engagement throughout the learning process. Therefore, I employed various interactive and hands-on activities, demonstrations, and engaging discussions to make the learning experience enjoyable and captivating for the children. By incorporating elements of fun and creativity, we were able to effectively teach robotics concepts and keep the children excited and motivated.</p>
