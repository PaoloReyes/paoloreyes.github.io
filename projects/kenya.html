<!--Kenya was a social action project that was born as a prize for developing the best social-technological project in Latin America in 2019 (E-GoKart). The goal of this project was to support the construction of schools and assist the local community with basic needs items.-->

                        <p>This project started in a different way than previous ones as it arose spontaneously and as a continuation of a previous project.</p><br> 
                        <p>Thanks to my project E-GoKart being chosen as the best social-technological project in Latin America, the company "DOW Chemicals" rewarded me with an all-expenses-paid trip to Kenya for social work. During this trip, I engaged in a variety of activities, some of which included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Building a kitchen in a primary school.</li>
                            <li>The construction of the foundations for a classroom at the first university in the area.</li>
                            <li>The task of carrying 400 liters of water from the nearest lake to the local homes.</li>
                            <li>The teaching of classes at a local school.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These activities left a lasting impact on me and transformed my perspective as I came to understand the privilege we have in other parts of the world simply by being able to access basic services and education. Since then, I have been driven to continue learning and developing with the intention of improving the quality of life for others in my community.</p><br>
                        <p>The daily interaction and bonding with the other 27 global winners during this experience was incredibly valuable to me. They came from diverse backgrounds, representing countries such as the United States, Taiwan, Algeria, and Egypt. Each of them brought innovative projects and ideas that they shared with me, broadening my perspective. It was a powerful reminder that while we may be focused on local issues, there are often more pressing and complex problems in other parts of the world that go unnoticed by us.</p><br>
                        <p>With this new perspective on the world and the network of communication with global leaders, I began to become the person I am today.</p>
