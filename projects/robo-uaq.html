                        <p>ROBOUAQ is a competition I participated with my classmates. It involved using an ackermann robot to drive autonomously along a driveway taking into account the signs in the environment, traffic lights and obstacles. The robot was equipped with a camera for computer vision and artifitial intelligence tasks and aimed to explore the capabilities of autonomous navigation while researching on new algorithms.</p><br>
                        <p>This project involved implementing various algorithms to perform autonomous tasks, it mainly used classical computer vision to identify and follow a track and a CNN to classify for signs on specific regions of the image. It provided hands-on experience with real-world applications of computer vision and autonomous systems, equipping me with valuable AI skills.</p><br>
                        <p>The competition was organized by the Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro, where my team and I won third place. We built a robot capable of doing autonomous navigation in an urban environment, using advanced AI and machine learning algorithms to detect traffic signals and avoid obstacles. Our efforts were recognized, and we were invited to participate in the international RoboWorld Cup in Brazil.
