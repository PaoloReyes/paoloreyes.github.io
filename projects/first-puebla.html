                        <p>This is the first year in which I don't belong to a FIRST team, either as a student or a mentor. However, in order to continue supporting the competition, I decided to register as a "robot inspector" for the Puebla regional event, which took place from March 16th to 20th at Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Puebla. My role was to verify that the 33 robots in the competition complied with all safety requirements. I ensured that their power sources, such as the battery, and all electronic circuits were functioning correctly. Additionally, I checked that the pneumatic systems did not pose any danger to individuals in the pits or on the field. I took my responsibilities seriously to create a safe environment for all participants. By conducting thorough inspections, I contributed to the overall success of the event and helped ensure that the teams could compete in a fair and secure manner.</p><br>
                        <p>In addition to my inspection duties, I volunteered to help solve issues with the mechanisms of the robots. Specifically, I redesigned the entire pneumatic system for a rookie team and explained the concept of current limit to the only all-female team in Mexico. This was to help them operate their arm correctly, as the excessive torque from their motor was causing it to break. By providing hands-on assistance and sharing my knowledge, I aimed to support these teams in overcoming technical challenges and improving the performance of their robots. It was rewarding to see them successfully address the issues they were facing and continue their competition journey with enhanced functionality and understanding.</p><br>
                        <p>On the final day of the competition, I took on the task of dismantling the field and preparing it to be shipped to Torreón for its next competition.</p>
