                        <p>This is a very interesting project as it repurposes a Kinect from an Xbox 360 to use it as a depth camera and employ it as a user interface method instead of traditional methods.</p><br>
                        <p>As examples of application for this sensor, I created a robot in the style of an arm with two degrees of freedom that replicated the movement of one of my arms using forward kinematics. I also developed a more complex second prototype of an intelligent arm that could reach any point in space autonomously using inverse kinematics.</p><br>
                        <p>In addition to my projects, I made a great contribution to the community as it seemed that all the resources on this topic had disappeared over 10 years ago. Somehow, I was able to retrieve them and share a <a href="https://youtu.be/9aNdWmKoTUM" target="_blank">video</a> about the installation process and how to start programming this depth camera, completely free and in Spanish. This has been recognized by many users on the internet.</p><br>
                        <p>Similarly, the two projects I mentioned earlier were documented, and the process to replicate them can be found in each of the following two videos:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/Oh6WBOk57_8" target="_blank">Direct kinematics.</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/8TaDrmI6Aas" target="_blank">Inverse kinematics.</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Similarly, in the following <a href="https://youtu.be/fQrLefnj2xo" target="_blank">video</a>, I demonstrate how it is possible to establish communication with Arduino to use signals from the depth camera to control external devices.</p>
