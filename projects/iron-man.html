                        <p>This project was born with the idea of creating a more creative costume for Halloween 2021. With that in mind, the best idea I had was to create an Iron Man helmet, as the Iron Man mask was gaining popularity at that time. Constructing it was relatively simple because the design already existed on the internet, and I only needed to scale the size of the pieces to fit my head and start printing.</p><br>
                        <p>After the printing process, I had to assemble all the pieces using instant glue because the mask couldn't be printed as a single piece. Once the pieces were glued together, I proceeded with the most tedious step, which was sanding all the visible surfaces to remove the natural lines left by a 3D printer. With that done, I painted the mask with red and gold spray paint until I achieved the desired result.</p><br>
                        <p>In terms of electronics, the brain of the mask was an Arduino Uno, and the actuator that allowed its movement was a 10kg servo motor. For the eye color, I used RGB LEDs, and as input sensors to indicate when to change color and when to open or close, I used capacitive touch sensors.</p>
