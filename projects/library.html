                        <p>As part of one of the services I offer, which is manufacturing, my partner and I received an order to design a custom bookshelf for an unused room in a church located near our workshop.</p><br><p>The general idea was to select a wall and create a series of deep boxes where large books could be placed, and on the second wall, install shelves for smaller books.</p><br><p>For the drawers, the measurements of the wall were taken into account, and a design was chosen to organize them in a somewhat creative way while maintaining a structure of rows and columns. As for the shelves, wooden shelves were designed with a front stopper to hold the books in place and prevent them from falling.</p>
