                <section class="about-text">
                    <p>As part of my "Internet of Things" course in the third semester of university, I had to create a project to automate a garden with 4 different plants. The idea was to monitor the moisture and temperature of each plant using an ESP32 microcontroller and communicate this data via MQTT (a Wi-Fi data communication protocol) to a Raspberry Pi 4. The Raspberry Pi would act as a local server, allowing access from any device to a webpage that synthesized all the current information of the plants and stored a history of past states every minute using a relational database like MySQL. In addition to monitoring, an automatic watering system with a water pump was implemented to water each plant when the moisture level dropped below a certain threshold, and a fan would activate when the temperature was too high.</p><br>
                    <p>The project was carried out by a team of 5 people. My role in the project was project management and task delegation to two sub-teams: the "Circuit Team" and the "Software Team." As the team member with the most experience and knowledge of the project, I took the lead in guiding the team through each stage of the project. My main responsibility was developing the C++ programs for the ESP32 microcontrollers.</p>
