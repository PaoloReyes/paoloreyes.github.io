<!--This was the second robot I built, and it was completely different from the first one. It measured over one meter in height and weighed 50 kilograms. This robot represented Mexico in the World Championship in Houston, Texas.-->

                    <p>This was the first larger-sized robot I was involved in. Its task was to pick up discs and balls and place them in spaceships at different heights. The operation of the robot was straightforward due to the team's limited experience.</p><br>
                    <p>A passive metal appendage was used, attached to an elevator, which allowed for the insertion and gravity-based locking of the disc to place it in the spaceship. Similarly, the elevator was connected to a set of flexible wheels capable of suctioning the balls and lifting them to the various heights of the spaceship.</p><br>
                    <p>The robot offered mobility across the playing field through a 6-wheel drive differential chassis, enabling movements forward, backward, and rotations on its own axis in both directions.</p><br>
                    <p>The ultimate goal of this robot was to climb a 60cm high platform, which was achieved using a linear elevator actuated by a lead screw that extended towards the robot's floor and lifted it. Then, a horizontal linear elevator on the floor slid the robot from a floating position to rest completely on the platform it needed to climb.</p>
