                        <p>With the arrival of the pandemic, I sought ways to promote care and protection against the unknown virus. One of my ideas was to create more visually appealing face masks compared to the standard blue ones available at the time. I designed a face mask with interchangeable filters, aiming to provide a reusable option with customizable designs on the front cover, allowing individuals to express their unique style while maintaining safety.</p><br><p>This face mask served as my primary means of protection during the pandemic until washable masks of the KN95 style and similar alternatives became available. These masks offered the advantage of being reusable and came in various colors and designs, providing more options and convenience in terms of both protection and style.</p><br><p>This mask was one of the many proposed solutions that my robotics team and I released on the internet for anyone to manufacture. The detailed report of this proposal can be found at the following <a href="https://blog.tecmilenio.mx/propositivo/wint-y-dow-por-el-bienestar-de-la-comunidad" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
