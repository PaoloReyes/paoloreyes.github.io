                        <p>The Engineering Expo, held annually at Tecnológico de Monterrey, is an event that celebrates innovation in engineering. I had the honor of participating and winning with my project: an interactive smart kiosk. This kiosk allows users to schedule activities on the school calendar, view buildings on a map, and order food, all through voice commands. Additionally, it features a hologram of TEUS, the school's mascot, to make the experience even more fun. It was an incredible opportunity to showcase my work and establish connections with professionals and other engineering enthusiasts.</p><br>
                        <p>My participation was a rewarding and enriching experience. It was exciting to showcase my project. During the event, I had the opportunity to interact with other students and industry professionals, allowing me to expand my network and learn about the latest trends in the field of engineering. Additionally, receiving recognition for my work has motivated me to continue pursuing innovation and the development of technological solutions. I am grateful for this experience and excited for future opportunities to continue showcasing my passion for engineering.</p>
