                        <p>Since I was 12 years old, I was gifted a LEGO Mindstorms kit, which is a special LEGO kit that includes not only traditional LEGO pieces but also electric motors and a programmable microcontroller. The kit provides step-by-step guides on how to build 5 different robots and their example codes. Despite having access to these resources, I never learned how to program, but I always wanted to create a Rubik's Cube solver. I tried to accomplish it back then but failed. However, during the free time I had due to the pandemic, I decided to give it another try, now with a basic understanding of programming. And at the age of 16, I was finally able to make it work.</p><br>
                        <p>Its operation was quite simple. First, you would manually scramble the Rubik's Cube and place it on the robot's square surface. The robot would then proceed to scan each square of every face, creating a mapping of the current state of the cube. Using a complex algorithm based on graphs, it would find the solution with the fewest moves, and the robot would begin solving it. Once the solving process was complete, the platform on which the cube rests would rotate, indicating a successful solution.</p>
