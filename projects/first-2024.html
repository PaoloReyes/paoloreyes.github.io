                        <p>This robot marked a new beginning for me, as I was collaborating with newcomers to FRC who had never interacted with robots like this before. Initially, I anticipated a lower-quality robot compared to what I'm accustomed to. However, to my surprise, these kids did an incredible job designing and building the robot. Combining their efforts with my extensive experience in C++ coding and control theory, we were able to create a remarkable machine. It not only met but surpassed the performance of every other robot I had previously built for an FRC competition.</p><br>
                        <p>The robot ultimately ranked 7th out of 29 teams and served as the captain of Alliance 5. During the competition, it faced off against Alliance 4 and emerged victorious. Subsequently, it competed against Alliance 1 but, regrettably, was defeated. However, it had another opportunity to stay in the competition by challenging Alliance 7, which it defeated effortlessly. This victory secured its spot to face Alliance 4 again for a chance to advance to the final round. Unfortunately, it was defeated once more, ultimately placing as the 4th best alliance in the regional competition. Nonetheless, this achievement earned it the Rookie All-Star Award.</p><br>
