                        <p>For my "Digital Logic Design" class in the fourth semester of my Robotics and Digital Systems Engineering degree, I created a webpage for my classmates to access resources for the design of traditional combinational circuits and complex sequential circuits that can be synthesized in an FPGA. The goal of the webpage is to explain the theoretical functioning of these circuits and provide examples of their description using three of the most popular hardware description languages in the industry: AHDL, VHDL, and Verilog.</p><br>
                        <p>The webpage had a significant impact on each of my classmates, as it provided them with solutions and guidance for their assignments and projects. Whenever they had doubts or needed assistance, they could simply access the webpage and find proposed solutions to adapt to their own design synthesis. One example for which I received many expressions of gratitude was the creation of an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). The ALU implemented a combinational division of N-bit numbers, and manually designing such a circuit would have been nearly impossible. Therefore, the way I implemented it using external libraries was highly appreciated by all my classmates. It not only simplified the ALU design but also facilitated the rest of their designs going forward.</p><br>
