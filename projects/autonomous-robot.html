                <section class="about-text">
                    <p>For my final school project, my team and I developed a differential mobile robot capable of navigating autonomously on a track using only a camera as a sensor and artificial intelligence for lane detection and sign recognition. This project showcased our ability to integrate advanced technologies and create a highly efficient autonomous navigation system.</p><br>

                    <p>Our robot was designed to be the fastest on the track, thanks to a unique fuzzy controller that significantly improved stability at high speeds. The camera provided real-time visual input, which was processed by a deep neural network to detect lanes and recognize signs accurately. This enabled the robot to make quick and precise adjustments, ensuring smooth and reliable navigation.</p><br>

                    <p>In addition to its speed and stability, the robot's use of artificial intelligence for lane detection and sign recognition set it apart from other projects. The AI algorithms were trained to interpret the visual data effectively, allowing the robot to respond appropriately to various track conditions and signage.</p><br>

                    <p>This project combined elements of robotics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. It provided us with valuable hands-on experience and a deep understanding of autonomous systems. Our robot's performance on the track demonstrated the effectiveness of our design and the potential for AI-driven navigation solutions in real-world applications.</p><br>

                    <p>Overall, this final project was a challenging yet rewarding experience, highlighting our ability to innovate and apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems. It has prepared us well for future endeavors in the field of robotics and automation.</p>
