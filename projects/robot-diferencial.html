                <section class="about-text">
                    <p>This was a robot that I built during the pandemic to learn concepts of control and trajectory tracking. Mechanically, it is a very simple robot as it only consists of two motors and a caster wheel to navigate through space using only 4 basic movements (Forward, Backward, Clockwise Rotation, and Counterclockwise Rotation). It could even be said that this is the most basic robot that anyone who is new to robotics has access to.</p><br>
                    <p>The difference between a very basic robot and what I created is immense because this robot served as a structure, but the real project was more about mathematics and programming rather than the robot itself.</p><br>
                    <p>The idea was to place encoders on the robot's wheels to determine the angular velocity of each wheel in each execution cycle of the code. With this data, I used the numerical integration method of Euler, due to the limited processing power of an Arduino Uno, to obtain an approximation of the relative position from the start of the robot. This allowed me to correct position errors for a given trajectory over time. In this way, I only needed to provide a vector with the angular velocity, linear velocity, and duration of that configuration to trace a curve over time. Furthermore, I could combine these vectors to trace any desired shape with the robot.</p>
