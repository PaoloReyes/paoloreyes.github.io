                        <p>A social experience where my fellow robotics engineering students and I share our engineering knowledge with teenagers facing drug-related challenges. This initiative is designed to inspire and empower these young individuals by exposing them to the fascinating world of robotics and engineering.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>During these sessions, we introduce the teenagers to the basics of robotics, programming, and engineering principles. We engage them in hands-on activities and projects, allowing them to build and program their own robots. These activities not only provide them with valuable technical skills but also promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork.</p><br>
                                                
                        <p>Our goal is to create a supportive and encouraging environment where these teenagers can explore their interests and potential in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). By sharing our knowledge and passion for engineering, we hope to ignite a spark of curiosity and ambition, offering them a positive and constructive outlet for their energies and helping them envision a brighter future.</p><br>
                                                
                        <p>This program has had a profound impact on both the teenagers and us as mentors. Seeing their enthusiasm and progress has been incredibly rewarding, and it has reinforced our belief in the power of education and mentorship to transform lives. We are committed to continuing this initiative and expanding its reach to more communities, making a difference one robot at a time.</p>
