                    <p>One of the first ways in which I stood out from the rest was by winning the Olimpiada del Conocimiento Infantil 2015 (Children's Knowledge Olympics). This is an intelligence competition for all sixth-grade students nationwide in Mexico. The elimination round consists of a series of exams to evaluate your knowledge, and the top 1000 results at the national level are awarded a scholarship for the duration of their studies. In addition to this, they also win a two-week trip to Mexico City as a cultural experience, where they get to meet and talk with the President of the Republic.</p><br>
                    <p>The elimination process may vary from state to state, but in my case, it started with a voluntary nomination among the students of my elementary school to take an exam. The best result from this exam would represent the school, and only one student can be nominated per institution. Surprisingly, I won this internal stage and moved on to compete in the zonal stage, which took place at another school. After winning at the zonal level, I proceeded to the regional stage and finally to the state level, which was the last stage of the competition.</p><br>
                    <p>In this stage, 72 winners were selected to represent the state of Mexico, and I was one of them. Since then, I have been receiving a scholarship from my state, and I will continue to receive an annual support of 10,000 pesos until I finish my university studies.</p>
