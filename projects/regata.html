                        <p>Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Toluca organizes an annual contest where teams of 5 people build a boat using only cardboard and plastic bottles. I participated in the 2022 edition where we built and decorated a cardboard boat with an emo theme in just 1 week, making reference to our team name "emos 2000".</p><br>
                        <p>The construction process was fairly simple as it didn't require complex materials or tools. We used several layers of sturdy cardboard and duct tape to secure the structure. The most time-consuming part was the decoration, as we had to cut out many squares and laminate them to prevent them from getting ruined by water. Additionally, we added some extra details using a 3D printer.</p><br>
                        <p>In the competition, we were only able to complete half of the course because the boat had excessive buoyant force and was very unstable. As a result, we capsized halfway through the race. Although we didn't win, we had a great time and learned a lot about buoyant force and teamwork.</p>
