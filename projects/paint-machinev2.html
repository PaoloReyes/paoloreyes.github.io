                <section class="about-text">
                    <p>Following the success of our first prototype, I am now working on the second version of the painting machine at the IDR Institute for the Development in Robotics. This new approach was born out of the challenges we faced with the initial design, where there was a significant amount of paint left in the pumps, making it nearly impossible to scale the solution efficiently. To address this, we transitioned from using peristaltic pumps to a machine with X and Y degrees of freedom, which can position the paint above the container and dispense it using a solenoid valve.</p><br>

                    <p>This upgrade aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of the color generation process for car repainting. By incorporating the X and Y degrees of freedom, we can achieve more accurate positioning of the paint, ensuring consistent and reliable color matches. The solenoid valve provides a more controlled and efficient paint dispensing mechanism, further streamlining the production process and reducing paint waste.</p><br>

                    <p>As the sole engineer on this project, I am once again responsible for coding the PLC, designing the 3D models, overseeing the manufacturing process, and handling the electronic systems. This second iteration of the machine presents new challenges and opportunities to refine and improve upon the original design.</p><br>

                    <p>Working on the second version of the painting machine has allowed me to deepen my understanding of robotics and automation. It has been a rewarding experience to apply the lessons learned from the first prototype to create an even more advanced and efficient solution. This project continues to push the boundaries of what is possible in the automotive industry, and I am excited to see the impact it will have on automating the color generation process.</p>
