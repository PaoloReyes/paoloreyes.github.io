                        <p>Due to being one of the top-performing students in my program, the department director of the university asked me to teach various courses to high school seniors who were considering their options for entering university. Some of the topics I taught included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Python programming for controlling drones.</li>
                            <li>Block programming for controlling spherical robots.</li>
                            <li>Networking (Operation of network routers).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a result of these courses, I was able to attract more students to pursue studies in the field of Computer Engineering and Information Technologies. Furthermore, students recognized me on campus and would greet me as the student who helped them make decisions about their future paths. It was a rewarding experience to have had a positive impact on their lives and assist them in choosing their career paths.</p>
