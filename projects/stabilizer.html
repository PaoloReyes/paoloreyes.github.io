                        <p>With my YouTube channel, I decided to record videos documenting the creation of my projects, and a video stabilizer is an essential tool for that purpose. However, I encountered a problem when trying to purchase one: the high costs involved. As a result, I chose to build my own video stabilizer instead.</p><br><p>Using SolidWorks, I designed the handle and movable components for the video stabilizer. The goal of this homemade device was to keep the phone in a stable position, either completely horizontal or vertical, regardless of how much my hand moved. To achieve this, two stepper motors were connected to tilt the phone from left to right and up and down. The rotation angles of these motors were determined using an accelerometer placed parallel to the top of my hand while holding the device. This allowed the inclination angles of the hand to be compensated with the tilt angles of the motors.</p><br><p>As an additional feature, I decided to add a joystick to change the default direction of the phone and achieve stabilization at different angles. With this joystick, it would also be possible to switch between vertical and horizontal orientations and make use of a third panning motor to rotate the phone with an additional degree of freedom.</p><br><p>The design, construction, and programming process can be found in the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImAfn5dD8ew" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
