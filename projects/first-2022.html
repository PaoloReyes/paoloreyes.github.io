                        <p>This is the latest robot I built for the "FIRST Robotics Competition." Just like in previous years, I took charge of the entire design process and mentored three generations of high school students to construct, wire, and program it. The robot's objectives were to collect balls from the ground and shoot them into a goal located over 2 meters high, as well as to hang onto a series of three different-height handrails ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 meters. The characteristics that made this robot unique were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Encoders to track the robot's position in real time.</li>
                            <li>Camera to measure angle and distance to the goal.</li>
                            <li>Encoders to measure the speed of the shot.</li>
                            <li>Automatic ball intake.</li>
                            <li>Automatic hanging sequence.</li>
                            <li>Magnetic extension arm limiters.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This robot won the Engineering Inspiration Award at the regional competition at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Monterrey campus, and earned us a spot at the world championship to represent Mexico in Houston among more than 400 teams.</p><br>
                        <p>At the world championship, we had a great performance aiming to make Mexico proud, and we finished in the 60th place in our division.</p><br>
                        <p>The design can be found on my <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/frc-2022-wint-3794-1" target="_blank">GrabCAD</a>.</p>
