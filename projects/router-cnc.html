                        <p>This is the project that I hold dear to my heart, as CNC machines are my favorite electromechanical devices in the world. After several years of learning about them and even attempting to replicate them on a smaller scale with two of my previous projects, <a href="./eggcnc" target="_blank">eggbot</a> and <a href="./plotter-cnc" target="_blank">plotter cnc</a>, the opportunity arose to build it on a larger scale with the help of my friend and former robotics teacher, Erick García.</p><br>
                        <p>The idea was to build the largest, most precise, and cost-effective machine possible, capable of cutting the parts we needed to construct robots (wood, polycarbonate, aluminum, hard plastics, etc.). That's why we decided to make the entire structure out of 3/4-inch plywood, use DIN rails and V-shaped bearings for the linear movement of the "x" and "y" axes, and finally, use steel shafts and linear bearings for the movement of the "z" axis. The active components of the system were NEMA 23 motors, coupled with timing belts for the "x" and "y" axes, and a lead screw for the "z" axis.</p><br>
                        <p>The program used to operate the CNC machine is Mach3, which allows us to control the machine manually. Additionally, we can use a command line interface to send instructions one by one. The best part is that we can import text files containing all the instructions for running the desired cut. These files are generated from DXF files in the VCarve program, which, in turn, can be created using design tools like Photoshop or 3D modeling software like SolidWorks.</p><br>
                        <p>With this machine, we have created many custom-made pieces for local businesses' decorations. We have also used it to manufacture parts for over 10 robots for the FRC competition throughout the country.</p>
