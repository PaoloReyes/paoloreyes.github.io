                <section class="about-text">
                    <p>For a period of my life, I dedicated myself to selling products online and making home deliveries. The challenge was that I had to make the deliveries on foot as I didn't have a car. Later, I decided to switch to making deliveries by bicycle. However, I found it tiring, so I decided to convert my bicycle into an electric one using motors I had at home and the control system from the competition robots I participated in. The process was challenging due to limited tools and budget, but somehow, I managed to get it up and running.</p><br>
                    <p>The electric bicycle had the following components:</p>
                    <ul class="text-lists">
                        <li>Three brushless NEO motors.</li>
                        <li>Three SPARK MAX motor controllers to control the speed by PWM pulses.</li>
                        <li>An arduino UNO as the brain of the bike.</li>
                        <li>A potentiometer connected to a brake lever that served as an accelerator.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The bicycle worked flawlessly and served me well for indefinite travel for nearly 3 months, until I had to return the components to the robotics team since they were not mine.</p>
