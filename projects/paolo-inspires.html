                <section class="about-text">
                    <p>This project is one of my greatest passions. It stems from my love for spreading knowledge because I believe that knowledge is of no use if it is not shared. The idea behind this project is to create videos on complex topics that are poorly taught in schools and for which there are limited resources available online. These videos are then uploaded to YouTube so that anyone can access them without having to pay for a course or for those individuals who want to learn but do not have the financial means to afford a university education.</p><br>

                    <p>The videos are created with great enthusiasm, and I continuously study to improve the quality of the audiovisual productions. That's why, for the past few months, my production standards require that all the content of a video be created using a programming language to produce engaging and dynamic animations. This approach has attracted many followers who appreciate that the visual resources help them better understand the topics being presented.</p><br>

                    <p>The channel not only serves as a platform for sharing knowledge but also as a means for me to continue learning. In order to create a video, I need to prepare and research to ensure that all the information I share is accurate and useful. This process of gathering and organizing information allows me to deepen my understanding of the topics and expand my own knowledge. It's a rewarding experience to both educate others and enhance my own learning journey through the channel.</p>
